# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
For this project, I was tasked with writing Python code to create a Flask app, utilizing a MongoDB database, that scrapes information from various websites and combines it into one database.  The app then displays the information in HTML code.  
## Results
The code scraped website information related to the following:
* Mars News
* Mars Featured Image
* Mars Facts
* Images of each of Mars's four (4) hemispheres
  * Ceberus
  * Schiaparelli
  * Syrtis Major
  * Valles Marineris

I was also tasked with customizing the HTML file and changed the font color of the titles, the application's background color, and added an image to the jumbotron.

## Summary
The Flask application scrapes the requested websites for the requested information everytime the user clickes on the "Scrape New Data" button, and displays those on the application's HTMl page.
